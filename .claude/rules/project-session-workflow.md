# Session workflow

> Project rule, loaded every session. Moved verbatim from the pre-guv `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-04 (guv adoption); the source text is Ian's.

> Review gate: `/guv:eval` (platform review + `guv:reviewer`) supersedes the `@evaluator` / `product-reviewer` pair named below (Ian's process note, 2026-08-31). Handoffs go through `/guv:handoff`.

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Session

1. **Run the tests:** `npm test`, establish baseline
2. **Load context:** Read `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` and the latest file in `docs/sessions/`
3. **Review recent changes:** `git log --oneline -10` to orient on recent work
4. **Plan:** Identify the next feature to implement within the current phase. State what you'll build and how you'll test it before writing code

### During a Session

- Work on **one feature at a time**. Complete it (including tests) before starting the next
- **After each completed feature, run a self-check:**
  1. `npm test`, all tests pass, no regressions
  2. `npm run build`, clean compile, no TypeScript errors
  3. Verify: no `any` types introduced, no TODO/FIXME left unresolved, no stubbed implementations
  4. If any check fails, fix before moving to the next feature
- Commit after each completed feature (after the self-check passes)
- If you encounter a decision point with multiple valid approaches, pause and explain the tradeoffs. Do not pick one silently

### Ending a Session

- **Invoke the evaluator subagent** (`@evaluator`) for an independent QA assessment of all work completed this session. Present the evaluator's full report without softening or editorializing. If the evaluator returns a FAIL verdict, address the critical issues before proceeding to handoff. You can also invoke `/evaluate` manually mid-session on specific features if you want earlier feedback
- Run the full test suite one final time
- Commit any uncommitted work
- Generate a session handoff artifact at `docs/sessions/session-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN.md` containing:
  - **Completed:** what was built this session, with commit references
  - **In Progress:** anything started but not finished
  - **Blocked:** anything that can't proceed and why
  - **Evaluator Results:** summary of the evaluator's scores and any unresolved issues
  - **Test State:** number of tests, all passing/any failing
  - **Next Steps:** the logical next feature(s) to tackle
- Update `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` with current completion state

### Session Artifact Conventions

When **writing** handoff artifacts, be concrete: "Built ContactForm with email, name, message fields. Fires `form_start` on first field focus and `form_submit` on submission. 4 tests added." Include commit hashes. Don't omit problems, if you cut a corner or stubbed something, say so. Keep "Next Steps" specific enough to start implementing immediately.

When **reading** handoff artifacts, prioritize: In Progress → Blocked → Next Steps → Evaluator Results. These determine what happens next. If unresolved critical issues from the evaluator exist, address those before new feature work.

When **updating PHASE_STATUS.md**, use the format: `✅ YYYY-MM-DD, session-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` for completed deliverables. Update the "Last updated" header line with the current date and session reference. See `.claude/skills/session-management/SKILL.md` for additional conventions on context continuity patterns across different gap durations.
