# Container entrypoint: initializes firewall as root, drops to claude user,
# then starts Claude Code with bypass permissions.
#
# This script runs as root (Docker default). It must:
# 1. Set up iptables firewall (requires root)
# 2. Fix ownership on bind-mounted workspace
# 3. Drop to the 'claude' user via exec runuser
#
# SETTINGS PATH MODEL:
# - Project settings: /workspace/.claude/settings.json (from bind mount)
#   Contains permissions, hooks, agents, commands, skills
# - User state: /home/claude/.claude/ (from named Docker volume)
#   Contains auth tokens, session history, auto-memory
# Claude Code merges both at runtime. Project settings take precedence
# over user settings for permissions and hooks.

set -e

# Step 1: Initialize firewall (running as root — no sudo needed)
/usr/local/bin/init-firewall.sh

# Step 2: Ensure the claude user owns its home directory volumes
# The named Docker volumes may have been created by root on first run
chown -R claude:claude /home/claude

# Step 3: Print banner and drop to non-root user

# Examples:
#   (no args)           → interactive session
#   --resume "name"     → resume named session
#   -p "prompt"         → headless single prompt
